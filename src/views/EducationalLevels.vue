            <h2>The Kindergarten and Lower Primary School</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of pre-school is to afford pupils a learning environment
              where they can learn through play to interact with peers, teachers
              and explore their environment. The early years foundation stage
              programme focuses on seven learning areas to develop a child
              holistically. These seven learning areas are further divided into
              three prime learning areas: Communication and Language; Personal,
              Social and Emotional Development (PSED); Physical Development and
              four specific areas of learning: Literacy, Mathematics,
              Understanding the world and expressive art and design, which
              ensures a solid foundational learning milestone of our pupils.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of Pre-school (Kindergarten 2), there is a transition
              to Key Stage One (Years 1 & 2), which is a two-year Cambridge
              Programme.
