        <h2>Statements of Beliefs</h2>
        <p>
          Takoradi International School believes that children are born with
          unique potentials that should be cultivated for holistic character and
          intellectual development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We recognise the crucial role parents play in the development of their
          child and believe it is essential to build a relationship based on
          mutuality, trustworthiness and cooperation between our school and
          parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also believe in imparting in our children the knowledge to enable
          them to accept the ever-evolving world as an interdependent global
          community where each individual is recognised as an equal member of
          the human family.

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>

          relationships of trust, respect, courtesy, tolerance and honesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive towards excellence by testing pupils’ creative and
          analytical thinking skills and their ability to transfer and apply
          these abilities to various situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We inculcate in our pupils a spirit of service and a sense of global
          loyalty, encouraging them to see themselves as World Citizens and
          begin to take an active role in making an impact on our evolving
          global society.

        <h2>The Kindergarten and Lower Primary School</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of pre-school is to afford pupils a learning environment
          where they can learn through play to interact with peers, teachers and
          explore their environment. The early years foundation stage programme
          focuses on seven learning areas to develop a child holistically. These
          seven learning areas are further divided into three prime learning
          areas: Communication and Language; Personal, Social and Emotional
          Development (PSED); Physical Development and four specific areas of
          learning: Literacy, Mathematics, Understanding the world and
          expressive art and design, which ensures a solid foundational learning
          milestone of our pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of Pre-school (Kindergarten 2), there is a transition to
          Key Stage One (Years 1 & 2), which is a two-year Cambridge Programme.

        <h2>The Kindergarten and Lower Primary School</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of pre-school is to afford pupils a learning environment
          where they can learn through play to interact with peers, teachers and
          explore their environment. The early years foundation stage programme
          focuses on seven learning areas to develop a child holistically. These
          seven learning areas are further divided into three prime learning
          areas: Communication and Language; Personal, Social and Emotional
          Development (PSED); Physical Development and four specific areas of
          learning: Literacy, Mathematics, Understanding the world and
          expressive art and design, which ensures a solid foundational learning
          milestone of our pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of Pre-school (Kindergarten 2), there is a transition to
          Key Stage One (Years 1 & 2), which is a two-year Cambridge Programme.
